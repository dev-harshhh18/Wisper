Today's Major Updates

We have two primary tasks to focus on today:

Bug Fixes – Resolve all reported issues before proceeding with enhancements.

Project Enhancements – Implement the improvements as outlined below.

⚠️ Notice: Ensure that every listed issue and enhancement is properly addressed. I expect a complete and satisfactory resolution without any omissions.

Bug Fixes in the Site:

Like Button Issue – Currently, when a user likes a post, it appears as liked for all users. Fix this so that the like button functions individually for each user.

Dark & Light Mode Transition – The transition effect is too slow. Maintain smoothness but reduce the transition duration for a more responsive experience.

Missing Pages for My Likes/Votes and Wisps – There are no pages where users can view and manage their likes, votes, and whispers. Ensure that these pages are added and fully functional.

Hover Light Effect in Dark Mode – When dark mode is enabled, a soft ambient white circular light should appear around the cursor on hover. This feature exists but is currently not working. Fix it.

Enhancements in the Site:

Privacy Policy Page – Create a well-structured Privacy Policy page with proper content. The footer should include credits:"Made in India – Harshad Nikam."

Feedback Section – Add a section where users can report issues and suggest improvements. Embed the following Google Form:Feedback Form

Activate My Wisps & Liked Wisps Pages – These pages should be fully functional under the Profile section.

Default Maintenance Page – If any page fails to load or is unavailable, it should automatically display a message:"Page is under maintenance."

Comment & Dislike Button –

Add a working Comment button.

Add a Dislike button, but keep the dislike count hidden from the public—only the original poster should be able to see it.

Enhanced Wisp Writing Options – Expand the wisp posting feature by allowing users to:

Add emojis

Create polls

Share their location (optionally worldwide)

Notification System – Implement a notification feature within the Profile section where users receive alerts for:

Likes and comments on their wisps (including a direct mention of the specific wisp)

Security alerts (e.g., "New login detected") to notify users if their account is accessed from a new device or location.

Major Upgrade – Docker & Local Setup

Docker Containerization –

Containerize the entire project to make it easily shareable.

Ensure all necessary configurations are included.

Shell Scripts for Local Setup –

Create a shell script to install all dependencies when running the project locally.

Develop another shell script to activate the project for local use.

Project Directory – The project files will be stored in:

/home/kali/Wisper

README.md File – Write a comprehensive README.md file that provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and running the project locally.

Final Note:

Please ensure all tasks are completed accurately and efficiently. If you encounter any issues, communicate them immediately rather than leaving them unresolved.
